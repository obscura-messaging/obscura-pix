/**
 * Writing an entry: store it locally, then send it (`docs/DOMAIN_CONTRACT.md`, "Local writes").

 * ## The order, and why
 *
 * ```
 * resolve audience → WRITE locally → THEN send
 * ```
 *
 * - **Audience first**, because it can throw. An entry with an unresolvable audience must not be
 *   stored either: a local row the user can see but that reached nobody is worse than a refusal.
 * - **Write before send**, because the local write is the one that must not be lost. The user's own
 *   content is theirs whether or not the network cooperated; a send failure is retriable, a lost
 *   write is not.
 *
 * ## The sender writes its own copy
 *
 * `send` produces no inbox row for the sender, so this is the only place an outgoing entry is
 * stored.
