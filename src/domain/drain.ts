/**
 * Planning an inbox drain (`docs/DOMAIN_CONTRACT.md`, "Drain").
 *
 * ```
 * for each row: classify → validate → AUTHORIZE → attribute → merge → write → consume | discard
 * ```
 *
 * - Authorize before storing: any authenticated user can deliver to any device.
 * - Consume only what was written. The inbox row is the only copy, so consuming first loses it.
 * - Discard what can never be processed. There is no skip cursor, so a skipped row would block the
 *   queue forever.
 *
 * Pure: takes rows and current state, returns a plan. `src/state/drainInbox.ts` applies it.
