 * drained with `peek → process → consume`, so an app that crashes mid-drain reprocesses those rows.
 * Convergence under replay is what makes that safe. **A future non-idempotent rule breaks the drain
 * contract with it.**

 * Which of two writes to the same id wins.
 *
 * APPEND — the entry is immutable, so the first write seen is kept and later duplicates are
 * ignored. Ids embed a timestamp and randomness, so a repeated id carries identical content and
 * order cannot matter.
 *
 * REPLACE — a total order on `(sentAt, authorDeviceId)`:
 *   1. strictly-greater `sentAt` wins;
 *   2. on equal `sentAt`, the lexicographically-higher `authorDeviceId` wins;
 *   3. equal on both is the same logical write — idempotent, keep what we have.
 *
 * Rule 2 is required. Without it an equal-timestamp conflict resolves to "whichever arrived
 * first", so two devices that receive the two writes in different orders converge to DIFFERENT
 * states and never reconcile — silently, and invisibly to single-device testing (`DOMAIN_CONTRACT.md`).
 * `pix.viewedAt` is written by the *recipient*, i.e. a second user, so equal timestamps are a real
 * collision and not a thought experiment.
