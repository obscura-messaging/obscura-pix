# Obscura

End-to-end encrypted messaging: a React Native app over ObscuraKit, the
Kotlin and Swift kits in the [`obscura-native`](obscura-native/) submodule.
Android is the release target. iOS ships internal TestFlight builds and works in
the foreground; push is not implemented ([iOS status](docs/IOS_PARITY.md)).

## Ownership

| Layer | Owns |
| --- | --- |
| TypeScript app (`src/`) | Model schemas, payload parsing, audience, authorization, merge, expiry, outbox, rendering |
| ObscuraKit | Auth, friends/devices, Signal, transport, typing, attachment encryption, durable inbox, opaque entry store |
| Android/iOS hosts | OS lifecycle, permissions, files, push, local notifications, React Native marshalling |

Never move application semantics into native code. Contracts:
[`DOMAIN_CONTRACT.md`](docs/DOMAIN_CONTRACT.md) (app),
[`BRIDGE.md`](docs/BRIDGE.md) (React Native bridge),
[`KIT_API.md`](https://github.com/obscura-messaging/obscura-native/blob/7b72b52d033f098f5444d38bf8d4608120efa8c2/docs/KIT_API.md) (kit).
