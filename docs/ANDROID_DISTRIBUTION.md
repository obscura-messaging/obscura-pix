# Android internal distribution

PR and `main` CI never distribute, and PRs never see distribution credentials
(they use the Firebase stub and debug signing). To ship, an owner
(`barrelmaker97` or `rhelsing`) runs **Actions → Release / Internal → Run
workflow** on `main`. `scripts/verify-internal-build.sh` checks the starting
and rerunning actor. It also requires the commit to be the current `main` tip
with a successful `main` CI run. Android and iOS then run independently.

`.github/workflows/internal-android.yml` builds that commit once as a signed,
minified universal APK. It keeps the APK and release notes as a GitHub artifact
for 30 days. A second job verifies the APK's checksum and commit, then sends it
to Firebase App Distribution. There is no tag and no Google Play upload.
The version code is 1000 plus the release run number. Never rerun a release
that has already uploaded; retry the failed jobs or start a new run.

## Firebase

The Firebase Android app must use package `dev.barrelmaker.obscura`. Enable App
Distribution, create a tester group, and add each tester's Google account. For
local push testing, use the real config
([CONTRIBUTING](../CONTRIBUTING.md#setup-and-builds)).

## Signing key

Create one long-lived key. Keep an encrypted backup outside the repository.
Every distributed APK must use this key, or it cannot update an existing
install. PKCS12 uses the same password for the store and the key.

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.config/obscura
keytool -genkeypair -v \
  -keystore ~/.config/obscura/android-release.p12 \
  -storetype PKCS12 \
  -alias obscura-release \
  -keyalg RSA -keysize 4096 -validity 10000
```

For a local signed build, create the gitignored `android/keystore.properties`.
The matching `ANDROID_RELEASE_STORE_FILE`, `ANDROID_RELEASE_STORE_PASSWORD`,
`ANDROID_RELEASE_KEY_ALIAS` and `ANDROID_RELEASE_KEY_PASSWORD` environment
variables override it. Then run `just android-distribution 1 1.0.0-test.1`.
Unlike `just android-release`, it fails if signing, version metadata or the
real Firebase config is missing.

```properties
storeFile=/absolute/path/to/android-release.p12
storePassword=...
keyAlias=obscura-release
keyPassword=...
```

## GitHub `android-internal` environment

Deployments are allowed only from `main`.

| Variable | Value |
| --- | --- |
| `GCP_WORKLOAD_IDENTITY_PROVIDER` | Full workload identity provider resource name |
| `GCP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT` | Distribution service-account email |
| `FIREBASE_ANDROID_APP_ID` | Firebase Android App ID |
| `FIREBASE_TESTER_GROUP` | App Distribution group alias |

| Secret | Value |
| --- | --- |
| `GOOGLE_SERVICES_JSON_BASE64` | Base64 of the real `google-services.json` |
| `ANDROID_RELEASE_KEYSTORE_BASE64` | Base64 of the PKCS12 key |
| `ANDROID_RELEASE_STORE_PASSWORD` | PKCS12 password |
| `ANDROID_RELEASE_KEY_ALIAS` | Normally `obscura-release` |
| `ANDROID_RELEASE_KEY_PASSWORD` | PKCS12 password |

Before building, the build job checks the config's package and App ID. It
writes credentials only to runner-temporary or gitignored paths. The delivery
job receives only the APK and the release notes, and it authenticates to Google
Cloud only after verifying them.

## Google authentication

Use GitHub OIDC with Google Workload Identity Federation. Never create a
service-account JSON key.

1. Restrict the provider to `obscura-messaging/obscura-pix`. Its attribute
   condition must also pin the calling and reusable workflows; a
   repository-only condition is too broad:

   ```text
   assertion.repository == 'obscura-messaging/obscura-pix' &&
   assertion.ref == 'refs/heads/main' &&
   assertion.event_name == 'workflow_dispatch' &&
   assertion.workflow_ref == 'obscura-messaging/obscura-pix/.github/workflows/release-internal.yml@refs/heads/main' &&
   assertion.job_workflow_ref == 'obscura-messaging/obscura-pix/.github/workflows/internal-android.yml@refs/heads/main'
   ```

2. Grant the repository principal `roles/iam.workloadIdentityUser` on a
   dedicated service account.
3. Grant that service account `roles/firebaseappdistro.admin` in the Firebase
   project.

## Installing

Firebase emails each new tester an invitation. Once they accept it, they can
install from the Firebase App Tester page. Later builds signed with the same
key update in place. The run's GitHub artifact is a fallback. These APKs are
not Play-ready AABs; Google Play needs its own versioned release process.
